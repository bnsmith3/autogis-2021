# AutoGIS 2021 Exercise 5

I created two maps that can be found in this repository: one static map and one interactive map.

 - [The static map](./dc_aa_pop_map.png) shows the percentage of people in each Washington D.C. census block who are African American. The census data is from 2020. I also overlaid the 2022 Washington D.C. wards over the map to show another layer of geographic separation. The census and ward data is from [Open Data DC](https://opendata.dc.gov).
 - [The interactive map](./dc_maps.html) shows two layers: 1) the percentage of people over the age of 18 in each Washington D. C. census block and 2) the percentage of housing units that are vacant in each Washington D. C. census block. The census data is from 2020 and is from [Open Data DC](https://opendata.dc.gov).
